My name is _Shea_, but friends call me **Kai** 🦾

I'm a web developer living in Seattle with 10 years of experience - I work at Nintendo as a manager of backend development. In my personal free time, I work on [Ghost](https://github.com/ghost-language/ghost), an object-oriented scripting language I created to explore language design, computer graphics, and ecosystems.

You can find me on Twitter at [kai___desu](https://twitter.com/@kai___desu) 🐦 よろしくお願いします
