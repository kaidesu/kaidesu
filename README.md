# How's it going?
My name is _Shea_, but friends call me **Kai** 🦾

I'm a web developer living in Seattle with over 8 years of experience. I work over at [efelle creative](https://seattlewebdesign.com) developing [FusionCMS](https://github.com/fusioncms/fusioncms), a free and open source CMS built with **Laravel**, **Vue**, and **Tailwind**. We use it to power hundreds of websites.

I'm currently learning **Go** while developing [Ghost](https://github.com/ghost-language/ghost), an object-oriented scripting language. I have some lofty goals for it, but taking it all one step at a time ✌️
